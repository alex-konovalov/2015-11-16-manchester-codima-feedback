This the text from the sticky notes, without alterations.

## Morning session: Shell lesson, instructor Kwasi Kwakwa

### Green notes:

* Good that you're going at the speed of the least experienced person in the room

* Friendly athmosphere :)

* Everyone had a chance to keep up

* Useful reminder of command prompt. The exercise with four possible answers
is good

* Thank you so much, it was great. However we need to be a bit more quick to
catch up other material such as pipes, filters, ...

* Learnt lots of new commands and shortcuts

* I enjoyed <non-readable word> this lecture on learning unix/shell

* Good enough: informative, valuable

* Clear and straightforward

* Learnt: pwd, mkdir, ls, deleting files and dir. Well done!

* Live coding great; Friendly; Signal system of sticky notes great

* Speed was good for most of it. Comfortable with taught topics

* Things make sense now!! :)

* Good. All my questions clearly answered - even on Twitter!

* Learning commands from scratch was very useful.

* Overall good and clear. I really understand what I came for


### Red notes:

* More setup time/smoother setup? Started a bit late =) (_written on green, though_)

* Pace was a little too slow for me

* Last exercise was a bit confusing at first

* More exercises would be Useful

* Please allow more time for writing longer commands, e.g. when
`nano ....txt` was introduced.

* nothing in particular!

* You need to be have time before start

* Could have been covered much more quickly

* Pace was very slow. Some participants seemed to spend a lot of time waiting

* Need more practice to know what directory I'm actually in

* Too fast in writing could not catch you and was stuck most of the time

* To improve: could have done `cd ..` earlier as people might get lost
going down file structure

* Ensure screens working before start. Would like to see the thesis that
caused all this trauma

* Perhaps, it was too easy, but I don't know about the experience of
others. I just expected something about bash - scripts, etc.


##Afternoon session: Make lesson, instructor Leighton Pritchard

### Green notes:

* Great! Thank you very much

* It was very good and useful

* Good

* Well explained + useful

* Very good. Well structured & paced

* Very well taught by the instructor - clear and easy to follow

* To improve: a bit fast at the end would have liked more tome to
understand `$(DAT_FILES)`

* good: really interesting + helpful answers to questions

* Make Quizzes work well!


### Red notes:

* To improve: a bit fast at the end would have liked more tome to
understand `$(DAT_FILES)` (_written on green, though_)

* Maybe a little fast (but this is probs more me being slow!)

* Python install should be suggested along with Git, GAP, etc.

* Probably would be better to avoid all mention of `*.dat`, or
just advise not to use it. It's just too much of a distraction.

* It seems like no one tested how `make` works on Windows.
Troubleshooting took a **long** time.


## General remarks (AK):

* Next time, check that the Eventrbite form has a field for dietary
requirements. This time, we were asking to indicated them in a separate
email.

* Check if this is suggested somewhere in instructor's guide: how to
enter `#` sign on a British keyboard?

* Next time, check that the whiteboard is both wide and not obstructed
by the screen. On Monday, it satisfied only the 1st of these two conditions.

* Suggestion for the debrief: instructions should not only tell how to
install the software, but also how to check that is has been installed
properly, e.g. starting the terminal and typing `git` or `make`. That
would help to avoid delays on Mondays.

* Idea for the future: Make lesson dependent on Python perfectly suites
workshops where Python is taught. I understand that it's a hard task to
maintain several lessons om Make automating different processes, but I
would be interested in having a version of this for the LaTeX paper
(with images, multiple files, data files that feed into the paper,
bibliography etc.)
